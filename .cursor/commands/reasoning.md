# Reasoning Mode

I need help with debugging or complex analysis.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'reasoning' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the reasoning guidelines from `.cursor/rules/02-reasoning.mdc`

## Context

This is a reasoning/debugging task. Focus on:
- Understanding why code behaves a certain way
- Tracing execution flows
- Forming and testing hypotheses
- Providing clear explanations of the analysis
