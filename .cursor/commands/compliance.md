# Compliance Mode

I need a code review or compliance check.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'compliance' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the compliance guidelines from `.cursor/rules/05-compliance.mdc`

## Context

This is a compliance/review task. Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Best practices validation
- Code quality issues
- Standards compliance
- Prioritizing findings by severity
