# Planning Mode

I need help with planning and architecture.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'planning' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the planning guidelines from `.cursor/rules/01-planning.mdc`

## Context

This is a planning/architecture task. Focus on:
- System design and structure
- Breaking down complex tasks
- Evaluating trade-offs
- Creating actionable implementation steps
