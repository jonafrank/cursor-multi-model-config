# Creative Mode

I need help implementing something new.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'creative' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the creative guidelines from `.cursor/rules/06-creative.mdc`

## Context

This is a creative/implementation task. Focus on:
- Building new features
- Creating new components
- Matching project conventions
- Including proper error handling
- Designing for maintainability
