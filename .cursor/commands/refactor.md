# Refactor Mode

I need help with code refactoring.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'refactor' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the refactoring guidelines from `.cursor/rules/03-refactor.mdc`

## Context

This is a refactoring task. Focus on:
- Preserving existing behavior
- Making incremental improvements
- Following DRY principles
- Matching existing codebase conventions
