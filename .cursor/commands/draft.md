# Draft Mode

I need a quick draft or prototype.

## Instructions

1. Read `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` to check the recommended model for 'draft' tasks
2. Suggest I switch to that model if I'm not using it
3. Apply the draft guidelines from `.cursor/rules/07-draft.mdc`

## Context

This is a draft/prototype task. Focus on:
- Speed over perfection
- Getting something working quickly
- Marking TODOs for later refinement
- Proving the concept first
