# Creative Mode

This rule activates for creative, generative, and implementation tasks.

## When This Applies

- Building new features
- Creating new files/components
- Implementing functionality from scratch
- Exploring novel solutions
- Prototyping ideas

## Model Recommendation

Check `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` for the `creative` model.

**Typical models for creative tasks:**
- `gpt-5.2` (completeness profile)
- `gpt-5.1-codex-high` (default profile)
- `gemini-2.5-flash` (cost_minimized profile)
- `composer-1` (fallback profile)

## Creative Guidelines

1. **Understand the goal**: Clarify requirements before building
2. **Consider the context**: Match existing patterns and style
3. **Think ahead**: Design for maintainability
4. **Be thorough**: Include error handling, edge cases
5. **Document**: Add comments for complex logic

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Matches project conventions
- [ ] Includes appropriate error handling
- [ ] Has clear naming
- [ ] Considers edge cases
- [ ] Is properly typed (if applicable)
- [ ] Includes necessary imports
- [ ] Follows DRY principles

## Output Format

For creative/implementation tasks:

1. **Approach**: Brief explanation of the solution
2. **Implementation**: The code
3. **Usage**: How to use it
4. **Notes**: Any considerations or next steps
