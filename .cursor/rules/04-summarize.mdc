# Summarize Mode

This rule activates for summarization and explanation tasks.

## When This Applies

- Explaining what code does
- Providing overviews of files/modules
- Documenting existing functionality
- Creating TL;DR summaries
- Onboarding explanations
- Pull Request Descriptions

## Model Recommendation

Check `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` for the `summarize` model.

**Typical models for summarization:**
- `kimi-k2-instruct` (completeness profile)
- `claude-4.5-haiku` (default/cost_minimized profile)
- `composer-1` (fallback profile)

## Summarization Guidelines

1. **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly
2. **Use layers**: Start high-level, then details if needed
3. **Highlight key points**: What's most important?
4. **Use structure**: Lists, headers, sections
5. **Avoid jargon**: Explain for the audience level

## Output Format

For summarization tasks:

### Quick Summary (TL;DR)
One to three sentences capturing the essence.

### Key Components
- Bullet points of main elements

### How It Works
Brief explanation of the flow/logic.

### Notable Details
Any important caveats or considerations.
