# Reasoning Mode

This rule activates for tasks requiring deep analysis and logical reasoning.

## When This Applies

- Debugging complex issues
- Understanding why code behaves a certain way
- Analyzing performance problems
- Tracing through execution flows
- Evaluating security implications

## Model Recommendation

Check `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` for the `reasoning` model.

**Typical models for reasoning:**
- `claude-4.5-opus-high` (completeness profile)
- `claude-4.5-opus` (default profile)
- `deepseek-r1-0528` (cost_minimized/fallback profile)

## Reasoning Guidelines

1. **Gather context**: Read relevant code before drawing conclusions
2. **Form hypotheses**: Consider multiple possible explanations
3. **Trace systematically**: Follow execution paths step by step
4. **Validate assumptions**: Check that premises are correct
5. **Explain clearly**: Make the reasoning chain visible

## Output Format

For reasoning tasks, structure your response as:

1. **Observation**: What we're seeing
2. **Hypothesis**: Possible explanations
3. **Analysis**: Step-by-step investigation
4. **Conclusion**: What we determined
5. **Solution**: Recommended fix (if applicable)
