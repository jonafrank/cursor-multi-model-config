# Planning Mode

This rule activates for planning and architectural tasks.

## When This Applies

- System design and architecture decisions
- Feature planning and scoping
- Breaking down complex tasks into steps
- Evaluating trade-offs between approaches
- Creating implementation roadmaps

## Model Recommendation

Check `.cursor/model-profiles/current-profile.json` for the `planning` model.

**Typical models for planning:**
- `gpt-5.1-codex-high` (completeness profile)
- `gpt-5.1-codex-low` (cost_minimized profile)
- `composer-1` (fallback profile)

## Planning Guidelines

1. **Start with requirements**: Clarify what the user wants to achieve
2. **Consider constraints**: Time, resources, existing code, dependencies
3. **Propose alternatives**: Offer 2-3 approaches when relevant
4. **Create actionable steps**: Break down into concrete tasks
5. **Identify risks**: Flag potential issues early

## Output Format

For planning tasks, structure your response as:

1. **Understanding**: Restate the goal
2. **Approach**: Recommended strategy
3. **Steps**: Numbered action items
4. **Considerations**: Trade-offs, risks, dependencies
